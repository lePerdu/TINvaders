# TI Invaders

This is a clone of the archaic arcade game "Space Invaders" for TI-83 series
calculators.


## Controls

RIGHT/LEFT - Move
2ND - Fire
CLEAR - Exit


## Scoring

Bottom invaders: 10 points
Middle invaders: 20 points
Top invaders: 40 points


## Building

A pre-built file exists in the `bin/` directory, though it can be rebuilt by
typing `make` in a terminal (requires make and spasm).


## Installation

Install to a calculator using a linking program such as TiLP
(http://www.tilp.info) or run on an emulator. If TilEm2
(http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilem) is installed, the program can be run using
`make run`.
